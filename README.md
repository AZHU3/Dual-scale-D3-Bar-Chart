Dual-scaled-D3-Bar-Charts
========================

This is a demo for creating dual-scaled bar charts using D3.js

I came across this task where I was asked to create a dual-scaled bar chart. As I googled around and, unfortunately, could not found any example, I decided to do it myself.

Please bear in mind that I am new to D3.js and this is actually my first time using it. I had heard of D3.js but never used it.

Note: since d3.js uses ajax to load tsv files, the files contained in the src folder cannot be run in a browser using file:///. Execute the following command in the under the src directory to create a HTTP server.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Use the following URL to access index.html

    http://localhost:8000/index.html
